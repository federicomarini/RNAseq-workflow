### Introduction  
RNA seq is an emerging technology for deep RNA sequencing. Not only does RNA seq technology have the ability to analyze differences in gene expression between samples, but can discover new isoforms of genes and analyze SNP variation of particular genes. This tutorial will cover the basic workflow for analyzing RNA seq data on host tissue. It will not cover the workflow for analyzing RNA seq on microbial community samples. For analysis of the meta-transcriptome using RNA seq, see the workflow for Whole Genome Sequencing Metagenomics (WGS Metagenomics) in a different tutorial.

#### 1a. Setup new directory for analysis
Many files are generated during the RNA seq workflow, so it is best to keep them stored in an organized directory. The first step before running/installing any tools, is to generate a directory structure for easier organization. The rest of this tutorial assumes your working directory (```pwd```) is within the ```new_rnaseq_analysis``` folder created during the first step, or whatever you choose to name the folder.  
<br>
**input** : per sample sequencing files (.fastq)  
**genome** : directory for storing genome of interest (.fasta/.fna)  
**annotation** : directory for storing the annotation file associated with host genome (.gtf/.gff3)  
**index** : directory that will store STAR aligner's index files   
**tools** : directory to store dependencies required for analysis  
**venv** : a virtual environment of python to store all dependencies  
**logs** : a directory to store all the logs files generated from SGE  

  
```{bash, eval = F}
# Make new root directory
mkdir new_rnaseq_analysis

# Change directory into new folder
cd new_rnaseq_analysis

# Make sub-directories to store:
mkdir -p input
mkdir -p genome
mkdir -p annotation
mkdir -p index
mkdir -p tools
mkdir -p logs
```

#### 1b. Setup new virtual environment to store tools
A new virtual environment will keep all the tools that are required for analysis in its own folder so that there are no errors intorduced into the system python installation and/or break and tools that require a particular version. Most of the tools require python 2.7+. After creating and activating the virtualenv, you should see ```(venv)``` on the command line. To check what version of python you are currently using, run the command ```python --version```.  

```{bash, eval = F}
# Load python (if not set on Python 2.7)
module load python/2.7.3

# Install the virtualenv package
pip install virtualenv --user

# Make a new virtual environment folder in the 
virtualenv venv --python=python2.7

# Start the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# Create a function to link tools to virtualenv
# Sourced from http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/docs/anadama_workflows/install.html#id1
function link() { ln -sv $(readlink -f "$1") $(pwd)/venv/bin/; }
```
Note: If there is an error during the virtualenv creation step that states ```The executable python2.7 (from --python=python2.7) does not exist```, then the cluster environment's python version is not set for Python 2.7+, so the command ```module load python/2.7.3``` must be run first before running the ```virtualenv venv --python=python2.7``` command.


#### 1c. Download an example dataset (Optional)
If you want to use an example dataset to practice the RNAseq alignment workflow, run the commands below to place a fastq file in the ```input``` folder.

```


### 2. Installing required tools
This workflow requires many different tools. Some of these tools maybe available on your cluster environment, but to ensure the correct versioning of the tools, it is suggested to install them again inside a virtual environment. See http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ for more information about using virtual-environments.
<br>
Tools that are required for processing are:  
a. **cutadapt**

```{bash, eval = F}
# Install MultiQC to the virtualenv
pip install multiqc
pip install click

# Check if MultiQC was installed properly
multiqc --version
```



### 3. Download host genome and annotation file
A host genome and annotation file are required for a complete RNA seq analysis. The annotation file contains the gene information associated with the coordinates of an alignment. The two files need to places in their respective folders before running the workflow. Additionally, There are different releases of the full mouse genome, so be aware which genome and which annotation file you are using for the sequencing alignment.  


#### 3a. Mouse genome
**Link:** http://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_releases/current.html   

```{bash, eval = F}
# Download mouse genome to the 'genome' folder
wget -P genome/ ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M10/GRCm38.p4.genome.fa.gz

# Download genome annotation file to the 'annotation' folder
wget -P annotation/ ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M10/gencode.vM10.annotation.gtf.gz

# Decompress
gunzip genome/GRCm38.p4.genome.fa.gz
gunzip annotation/gencode.vM10.annotation.gtf.gz
```

#### 3b. Human genome
**Link:** http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/current.html  

```{bash, eval = F}
# Download human genome to the 'genome' folder
wget -p genome/ ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_25/GRCh38.p7.genome.fa.gz

# Download genome annotation file to the 'annotation' folder
wget -P annotation/ ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_25/gencode.v25.annotation.gtf.gz

# Decompress
gunzip genome/GRCh38.p7.genome.fa.gz
gunzip annotation/gencode.v25.annotation.gtf.gz
```

#### 3c. Other genome
If you are not working with a mouse or human genome, see the following websites for a complete listing.  
https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway  
http://useast.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html  


### 4. Generate STAR aligner index
The STAR aligner requires an index to be created before aligning any ```fastq``` sequences. The index command requires the host genome of interest and associated annotation file as inputs. The command is best run on the cluster, but should be submitted as a job. Download the shell file and submit it as a job. Additionally you must specific the length of the sequences in the RNAseq run in the command. This is typically 50 or 101, but will depend on what was requested.

```{bash, eval = F}
# Download index job file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbattaglia/RNAseq-workflow/master/make_index.sh

# Submit the make_index.sh as a job. Set the read length to 50bp.
qsub make_index.sh 50
```


### 5. Download workflow and change parameters
Once the index has been generated and all of the tools are installed, it is time to start the alignment workflow. The workflow is stored as a shell (.sh) file which submits an array job which will iterate over each input ```.fastq.gz``` file.
<br>  
Before submitting the command, make sure you change the variables within the file to reflect your data set.    
**qualityCutoff** : The minimum Phred score to retain nucleotides  [Default = 20]  
**trimLength** :  The minimum length of the sequence to keep after quality trimming. Typically 60% of the total length or greater. [Default = 20]  
```{bash, eval = F}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbattaglia/RNAseq-workflow/master/run_workflow.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twbattaglia/RNAseq-workflow/master/postprocessing.sh
```



### 6a. Run the workflow in parallel
The job can be submitted to the cluster once you have changed the parameters to reflect your data and you have placed the ```.fastq.gz``` files into the folder, ```input```. The command is written to submit an array job, which means you must specify how many times the job should run. In this case it is dependent upon how many individual ```.fastq.gz``` files that are located in the ```input``` folder. If there are 6 different samples within the folder you would run the command ```qsub -t 1:6 run_workflow.sh```, but if you have 10 files, you would run the command ```qsub -t 1:10 run_workflow.sh```. The ```-t``` flag corresponds to how many different commands should be submitted.
```{bash, eval = F}
qsub -t 1:6 run_workflow.sh
```
**Note:** The command is written for SGE clusters, but if you have a different cluster set up, you can change the variable ```$SGE_TASK_ID``` to the correct array style variable.


### 6b. Process the output files and generate a report 
After the main workflow has finished running, you will have generated aligned ```.bam``` files for each sample. These files only give the coordinates for the sequence alignments on the genome, and must be summarized to give gene counts per sample, before any statistical analysis can be performed. To do this we perform further processing the output files using the ```post-processing.sh``` script There is no need for a parallel array script and the command can be submitted as is as long as no folder names/locations were not changed in main workflow step.  
```{bash, eval = F}
qsub post-processing.sh
```

### 6c. Outputs from running the workflow
Many files are generated after running the main workflow and the post-processing scripts. Below is a breakdown of each of the folders and their respective description of their outputs. Each step reports a log file for every sample which can be used to calculcated the number of sequences.  
```{bash, eval = F}
‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_initial_qc/ - FastQC quality reports for each sample
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_trimmed_output/ - Trimmed reports for each sample
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_rRNA
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aligned/ - Sequences aligned to rRNA databases
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filtered/ - Sequences with rRNA sequences removed
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/ - Logs from running SortMeRNA
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4_aligned_sequences
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aligned_bam/ - Main alignment files for each sample
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aligned_logs/ - Log from running STAR alignment step
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aligned_counts/ - STAR alignment counts output (for comparison with featureCounts)
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 5_final_counts - Final gene count summarization output from running featureCounts
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 6_multiQC - Overall workflow report
```




### 7. Differential expression analysis using R
Once the workflow has completed, you can now use the gene count table as an input into DESeq2 for statistical analysis using the R-programming language. It is highly reccomended to use **RStudio** when writing R code and generating R-related analyses. You can download RStudio for your system here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/  
  
#### 7a. Generate a metadata file
One additional required file which is needed is a type of metadata file. This can be created in R or it can be imported as a text file. The mapping file must have sample identifiers that match the the resulting table with more columns that describe the sample (e.g Treatment).



#### 7b. Install required R-libraries
Multiple libraries are required to perform analysis, plotting and enrichment. 
```{R, eval = F}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("DESeq2")
biocLite("ggplot2")
biocLite("gplots")
biocLite("clusterProfiler")
biocLite("biomaRt")
biocLite("ReactomePA")
biocLite("DOSE")
biocLite("KEGG.db")
biocLite("pathview")
biocLite("org.Mm.eg.db")
biocLite("org.Hs.eg.db")
biocLite("pheatmap")
biocLite("genefilter")
biocLite("fdrtool")
biocLite("RColorBrewer")
biocLite("topGO")
biocLite("dplyr")
biocLite("NMF")
```


#### 7c. Using featureCounts output
One you have an R environment appropriatley set up, you can begin to import the featureCounts output of genes counts, found within the ```5_final_counts``` folder. This tutorial will use DESeq2 to normalize and perform the statistical analysis between sample groups. Be sure to copy the ```final_counts.txt``` file generate from featureCounts step to your set working directory, or specify the full location when importing the table.

### 8. Gene annotation

#### 8a. Gathering gene annotation information
```{R, eval = F}
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(org.Mm.eg.db)

# Add gene full name
res$description <- mapIds(x = org.Mm.eg.db,
                          keys = row.names(res),

            quote = F,
            col.names = NA)
```


### 9. Plotting gene data

#### 9a. PCA of highest variance genes

```{R, eval = F}

# Convert all samples to rlog
ddsMat_rlog <- rlog(ddsMat, blind = FALSE)

# Plot PCA by column variable
plotPCA(ddsMat_rlog, intgroup = "Group")
```


#### 9b. Heatmap of significant genes

# Necessary to show data in plots
rld <- rlog(ddsMat)

# Gather top genes and make matrix
mat <- assay(rld[row.names(res_out_sig)])

# Make colored column annotations.
# Choose which column variables you want to annotate the columns by.
annotation_col = data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(colData(rld)$Group),
  row.names = colData(rld)$SampleID
)

# Make Heatmap with pheatmap function.

### 10. Pathway analysis on differentially expressed genes. 
The code below assumes you have RNA seq results from the mouse genome.  
Get more information about clusterProfiler here: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/clusterProfiler/inst/doc/clusterProfiler.html
```{R, eval = F}
# Load required libraries
library(clusterProfiler)
library(ReactomePA)
library(KEGG.db)
library(DOSE)
library(pathview)
library(org.Mm.eg.db)

# Create a matrix of gene entrez ID's and log fold changes
gene_matrix <- res_out_sig$logFC
names(gene_matrix) <- res_out_sig$entrez


# - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# Enrich with KEGG database
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
kegg_enrich <- enrichKEGG(gene = names(gene_matrix),
                 organism = 'mouse',
                 pvalueCutoff = 0.05, 
                 readable = TRUE)
                 
# Get table of results
summary(kegg_enrich)

# Plot results
barplot(kegg_enrich, drop=TRUE, showCategory=12)

# Plot specific KEGG pathways (w fold change) with pathview
# pathway.id : KEGG pathway
pathview(gene.data = gene_matrix, 
         pathway.id = "04940", 
         species = "mouse", 
         map.symbol = T)


# - - - - - - - - - - - - -

go_enrich <- groupGO(gene = gene_matrix,
               organism = 'mouse',
               ont = "BP",
               level = 3,
               readable = TRUE)

# Get table of results
summary(go_enrich)

# Plot results
barplot(go_enrich, drop=TRUE, showCategory=12)
